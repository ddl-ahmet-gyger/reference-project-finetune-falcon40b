# reference-project-finetune-falcon40b
This reference project shows how to fine tune the Falcon-40b on a [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) to summarize conversations using the Huggingface Trainer. In this project, we will use the 4bit and 8bit quantized version of the model and train a LoRA adapter. We used a `g4dn.12xlarge` AWS instance to train the model.

Here are a list of important files in the project that you might need to edit in order to customize this further for your use case.

* [hf_falcon_40b-4bit.ipynb](hf_falcon_40b-4bit.ipynb) : This file contains all the code to load and finetune the Falcon-40B model on the [samsum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) dataset. The bitsandbytes configuration loads the model in 4 bit and trains a LoRA adapter

* [hf_falcon_40b-8bit.ipynb](hf_falcon_40b-8bit.ipynb) : This file contains all the code to load and finetune the Falcon-40B model on the [samsum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) dataset. The bitsandbytes configuration loads the model in 8 bit and trains a LoRA adapter

* [generate-4bit.ipynb](generate-4bit.ipynb) : This file contains code to load the Falcon-40B model in 4 bit precision, add an adapter to the model and take a user prompt to generate an output

* [generate-4bit.ipynb](generate-8bit.ipynb) : This file contains code to load the Falcon-40B model in 8 bit precision, add an adapter to the model and take a user prompt to generate an output

* [save_8_bit.ipynb](save_8_bit.ipynb) : This file saves the Falcon-40B model in 8 bit to disc so it can be used in future runs without having to download the model again from the Huggingface Hub. If you are using a model saved to disc, please change the value of the `model_id` variable in the `hf_falcon_40b-4bit.ipynb` and `hf_falcon_40b-4bit.ipynb` notebooks to point to the location of the model on disc.
